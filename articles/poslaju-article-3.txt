In a press statement by Pos Malaysia Berhad (Pos Malaysia), the company has stated that it’s operations have been impacted due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.

“While there is an increase in parcel volume throughout the MCO, Pos Malaysia’s other businesses namely mail, international parcels, Pos Aviation, Pos Logistics and others have been affected. Despite this, Pos Malaysia continues to protect the livelihood of over 15,000 front liners and operational support employees and ensure that their needs are prioritised,” it said.

This comes after a viral tweet showed a Pos Laju employee receiving news of no bonus hand-outs this year. “Last year, the company paid out a bonus of RM1,000. This year, the workload has increased but there is no bonus,” said the postman.

While many severely-impacted sectors in the country resorted to salary reductions, job cuts or other drastic measures, Pos Malaysia has assured in ensuring their employees’ future are protected.

“Pos Malaysia is currently undergoing a transformation process to turn the business around. As our transformation plan progresses and situation has improved, we will ensure better rewards for our people. At the same time, while the business is adjusting to the new normal, we continue to carry out our responsibility and serve the country as an essential service provider during this challenging time.”

“This spirit is embedded in our DNA and is our obligation under the Universal Service Obligation (USO). We are also grateful for the collective effort by our employees, who worked tirelessly to ensure deliveries and services are carried out with minimal disruptions especially toward the Hari Raya Aidilfitri festive season,” the company stated.

The Covid-19 pandemic is a global issue that is affecting supply-chains worldwide, causing the weakening or closing of businesses and the loss of livelihoods for many. Malaysia is also not excluded from this global crisis.
